# Use fslslice to split a 3D file into lots of 2D files (along z-axis).

#     Examples
#     --------
# 
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces.fsl import Slice
#     >>> slice = Slice()
#     >>> slice.inputs.in_file = 'functional.nii'
#     >>> slice.inputs.out_base_name = 'sl'
#     >>> slice.cmdline
#     'fslslice functional.nii sl'

  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
