inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
    midmat: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of file containing mid-warp-affine transform
    out_file: Path
    # type=file: Name of output file, containing the warp as field or coefficients.
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of output file, containing warps that are the combination of all those given as arguments. The format of this will be a field-file (rather than spline coefficients) with any affine components included.
    postmat: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of file containing an affine transform (applied last). It could e.g. be an affine transform that maps the MNI152-space into a better approximation to the Talairach-space (if indeed there is one).
    premat: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: filename for pre-transform (affine matrix)
    reference: medimage/nifti1
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of a file in target space of the full transform.
    shift_in_file: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of file containing a "shiftmap", a non-linear transform with displacements only in one direction (applied first, before premat). This would typically be a fieldmap that has been pre-processed using fugue that maps a subjects functional (EPI) data onto an undistorted space (i.e. a space that corresponds to his/her true anatomy).
    warp1: medimage/nifti1
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of file containing initial warp-fields/coefficients (follows premat). This could e.g. be a fnirt-transform from a subjects structural scan to an average of a group of subjects.
    warp2: generic/file
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of file containing secondary warp-fields/coefficients (after warp1/midmat but before postmat). This could e.g. be a fnirt-transform from the average of a group of subjects to some standard space (e.g. MNI152).

  requirements:

    shift_direction:
    # type=enum|default='y-'|allowed['x','x-','y','y-','z','z-']: Indicates the direction that the distortions from --shiftmap goes. It depends on the direction and polarity of the phase-encoding in the EPI sequence.

    # type=bool|default=False: Constrain the Jacobian of the warpfield to lie within specified min/max limits.

    # type=float|default=0.0: Maximum acceptable Jacobian value for constraint (default 100.0)
    abswarp:
    # type=bool|default=False: If set it indicates that the warps in --warp1 and --warp2 should be interpreted as absolute. I.e. the values in --warp1/2 are the coordinates in the next space, rather than displacements. This flag is ignored if --warp1/2 was created by fnirt, which always creates relative displacements.

    # type=bool|default=False: If set it indicates that the warps in --warp1/2 should be interpreted as relative. I.e. the values in --warp1/2 are displacements from the coordinates in the next space.

    # type=bool|default=False: If set it indicates that the warps in --out should be absolute, i.e. the values in --out are displacements from the coordinates in --ref.
