inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
  callable_defaults:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set as the `default` method of input fields
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
outputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface

    fsf_files: generic/file+list-of
    # type=outputmultiobject: FSL feat specification files
  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)
    interscan_interval:
    # type=float|default=0.0: Interscan  interval (in secs)
    session_info:
    # type=any|default=None: Session specific information generated by ``modelgen.SpecifyModel``
    bases:
    # type=traitcompound|default=None: name of basis function and options e.g., {'dgamma': {'derivs': True}}
    orthogonalization:
    # type=dict|default={}: which regressors to make orthogonal e.g., {1: {0:0,1:0,2:0}, 2: {0:1,1:1,2:0}} to make the second regressor in a 2-regressor model orthogonal to the first.
    model_serial_correlations:
    # type=bool|default=False: Option to model serial correlations using an autoregressive estimator (order 1). Setting this option is only useful in the context of the fsf file. If you set this to False, you need to repeat this option for FILMGLS by setting autocorr_noestimate to True
    contrasts:
    # type=list|default=[]: List of contrasts with each contrast being a list of the form - [('name', 'stat', [condition list], [weight list], [session list])]. if session list is None or not provided, all sessions are used. For F contrasts, the condition list should contain previously defined T-contrasts.
  imports:
  # list[nipype2pydra.task.base.importstatement] - list import statements required by the test, with each list item
  # consisting of 'module', 'name', and optionally 'alias' keys
  expected_outputs:
  # dict[str, str] - expected values for selected outputs, noting that tests will typically
  # be terminated before they complete for time-saving reasons, and therefore
  # these values will be ignored, when running in CI
  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test,
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
  xfail: true
  # bool - whether the unittest is expected to fail or not. Set to false
  # when you are satisfied with the edits you have made to this file
doctests: []
