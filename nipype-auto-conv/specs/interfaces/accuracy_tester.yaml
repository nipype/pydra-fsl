#     Test the accuracy of an existing training dataset on a set of hand-labelled subjects.
#     Note: This may or may not be working. Couldn't presently not confirm because fix fails on this (even outside of nipype) without leaving an error msg.

inputs:
  omit:

  types:
    # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
    # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred

  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`

  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)

  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`

  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
  - inputs:

    # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
