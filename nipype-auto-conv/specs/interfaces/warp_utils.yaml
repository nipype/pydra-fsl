inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface
  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.
    in_file: medimage/nifti1
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of file containing warp-coefficients/fields. This would typically be the output from the --cout switch of fnirt (but can also use fields, like the output from --fout).
    out_file: Path
    # type=file: Name of output file, containing the warp as field or coefficients.
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of output file. The format of the output depends on what other parameters are set. The default format is a (4D) field-file. If the --outformat is set to spline the format will be a (4D) file of spline coefficients.
    out_jacobian: Path
    # type=file: Name of output file, containing the map of the determinant of the Jacobian
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Specifies that a (3D) file of Jacobian determinants corresponding to --in should be produced and written to filename.
    reference: medimage/nifti1
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of a file in target space. Note that the target space is now different from the target space that was used to create the --warp file. It would typically be the file that was specified with the --in argument when running fnirt.
  callable_defaults:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set as the `default` method of input fields
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
outputs:
  omit:

  rename:
  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface

    out_file: generic/file
    # type=file: Name of output file, containing the warp as field or coefficients.
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of output file. The format of the output depends on what other parameters are set. The default format is a (4D) field-file. If the --outformat is set to spline the format will be a (4D) file of spline coefficients.
    out_jacobian: generic/file
    # type=file: Name of output file, containing the map of the determinant of the Jacobian
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Specifies that a (3D) file of Jacobian determinants corresponding to --in should be produced and written to filename.
  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)
    in_file:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of file containing warp-coefficients/fields. This would typically be the output from the --cout switch of fnirt (but can also use fields, like the output from --fout).
    reference:
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of a file in target space. Note that the target space is now different from the target space that was used to create the --warp file. It would typically be the file that was specified with the --in argument when running fnirt.
    out_format:
    # type=enum|default='spline'|allowed['field','spline']: Specifies the output format. If set to field (default) the output will be a (4D) field-file. If set to spline the format will be a (4D) file of spline coefficients.
    warp_resolution:
    # type=tuple|default=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0): Specifies the resolution/knot-spacing of the splines pertaining to the coefficients in the --out file. This parameter is only relevant if --outformat is set to spline. It should be noted that if the --in file has a higher resolution, the resulting coefficients will pertain to the closest (in a least-squares sense) file in the space of fields with the --warpres resolution. It should also be noted that the resolution will always be an integer multiple of the voxel size.
    knot_space:
    # type=tuple|default=(0, 0, 0): Alternative (to --warpres) specification of the resolution of the output spline-field.
    out_file:
    # type=file: Name of output file, containing the warp as field or coefficients.
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of output file. The format of the output depends on what other parameters are set. The default format is a (4D) field-file. If the --outformat is set to spline the format will be a (4D) file of spline coefficients.
    write_jacobian:
    # type=bool|default=False: Switch on --jac flag with automatically generated filename
    out_jacobian:
    # type=file: Name of output file, containing the map of the determinant of the Jacobian
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Specifies that a (3D) file of Jacobian determinants corresponding to --in should be produced and written to filename.
    with_affine:
    # type=bool|default=False: Specifies that the affine transform (i.e. that which was specified for the --aff parameter in fnirt) should be included as displacements in the --out file. That can be useful for interfacing with software that cannot decode FSL/fnirt coefficient-files (where the affine transform is stored separately from the displacements).

    # type=enum|default='NIFTI'|allowed['NIFTI','NIFTI_GZ','NIFTI_PAIR','NIFTI_PAIR_GZ']: FSL output type

    out_format: '"spline"'
    # type=enum|default='spline'|allowed['field','spline']: Specifies the output format. If set to field (default) the output will be a (4D) field-file. If set to spline the format will be a (4D) file of spline coefficients.

    # type=tuple|default=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0): Specifies the resolution/knot-spacing of the splines pertaining to the coefficients in the --out file.
