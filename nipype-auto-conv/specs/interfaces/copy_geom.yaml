# Use fslcpgeom to copy the header geometry information to another image.
#     Copy certain parts of the header information (image dimensions, voxel
#     dimensions, voxel dimensions units string, image orientation/origin or
#     qform/sform info) from one image to another. Note that only copies from
#     Analyze to Analyze or Nifti to Nifti will work properly. Copying from
#     different files will result in loss of information or potentially incorrect
#     settings.
