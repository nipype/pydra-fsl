# Use fsl_tsplot to plot the estimated motion parameters from a
#     realignment program.
# 
# 
#     Examples
#     --------
# 
#     >>> import nipype.interfaces.fsl as fsl
#     >>> plotter = fsl.PlotMotionParams()
#     >>> plotter.inputs.in_file = 'functional.par'
#     >>> plotter.inputs.in_source = 'fsl'
#     >>> plotter.inputs.plot_type = 'rotations'
#     >>> res = plotter.run() #doctest: +SKIP
# 
# 
#     Notes
#     -----
# 
#     The 'in_source' attribute determines the order of columns that are expected
#     in the source file.  FSL prints motion parameters in the order rotations,
#     translations, while SPM prints them in the opposite order.  This interface
#     should be able to plot timecourses of motion parameters generated from
#     other sources as long as they fall under one of these two patterns.  For
#     more flexibility, see the :class:`fsl.PlotTimeSeries` interface.
