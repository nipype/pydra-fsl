  # dict[str, str] - fields to rename in the Pydra interface
  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.

    # type=file: Name of output file, containing warps that are the "reverse" of those in --warp.
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of output file, containing warps that are the "reverse" of those in --warp. This will be a field-file (rather than a file of spline coefficients), and it will have any affine component included as part of the displacements.
    reference: medimage/nifti1
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of a file in target space. Note that the target space is now different from the target space that was used to create the --warp file. It would typically be the file that was specified with the --in argument when running fnirt.
    warp: medimage/nifti1
    # type=file|default=<undefined>: Name of file containing warp-coefficients/fields. This would typically be the output from the --cout switch of fnirt (but can also use fields, like the output from --fout).
  callable_defaults:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set as the `default` method of input fields
  metadata:
  # dict[str, dict[str, any]] - additional metadata to set on any of the input fields (e.g. out_file: position: 1)
outputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface

  callables:
  # dict[str, str] - names of methods/callable classes defined in the adjacent `*_callables.py`
  # to set to the `callable` attribute of output fields
  templates:
  # dict[str, str] - `output_file_template` values to be provided to output fields
  requirements:
  # dict[str, list[str]] - input fields that are required to be provided for the output field to be present
tests:
- inputs:
  # dict[str, str] - values to provide to inputs fields in the task initialisation
  # (if not specified, will try to choose a sensible value)

    absolute:
    # type=bool|default=False: If set it indicates that the warps in --warp should be interpreted as absolute, provided that it is not created by fnirt (which always uses relative warps). If set it also indicates that the output --out should be absolute.
    relative:
    # type=bool|default=False: If set it indicates that the warps in --warp should be interpreted as relative. I.e. the values in --warp are displacements from the coordinates in the --ref space. If set it also indicates that the output --out should be relative.
    niter:
    # type=int|default=0: Determines how many iterations of the gradient-descent search that should be run.
    regularise:
    # type=float|default=0.0: Regularization strength (default=1.0).
    noconstraint:
    # type=bool|default=False: Do not apply Jacobian constraint
