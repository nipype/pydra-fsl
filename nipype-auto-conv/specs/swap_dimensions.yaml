# Use fslswapdim to alter the orientation of an image.
#
#     This interface accepts a three-tuple corresponding to the new
#     orientation.  You may either provide dimension ids in the form of
#     (-)x, (-)y, or (-z), or nifti-syle dimension codes
#     (RL, LR, AP, PA, IS, SI).

inputs:
  omit:
  # list[str] - fields to omit from the Pydra interface

  types:
  # dict[str, type] - override inferred types (use "mime-like" string for file-format types,
  # e.g. 'medimage/nifti-gz'). For most fields the type will be correctly inferred
  # from the nipype interface, but you may want to be more specific, particularly
  # for file types, where specifying the format also specifies the file that will be
  # passed to the field in the automatically generated unittests.

- inputs:

  timeout: 10
  # int - the value to set for the timeout in the generated test,
  # after which the test will be considered to have been initialised
  # successfully. Set to 0 to disable the timeout (warning, this could
  # lead to the unittests taking a very long time to complete)
