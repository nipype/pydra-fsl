# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of
# 'nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.Vest2Text' from Nipype to Pydra.
#
# Please fill-in/edit the fields below where appropriate

# Docs
# ----
#
#     Use FSL Vest2Text`https://web.mit.edu/fsl_v5.0.10/fsl/doc/wiki/GLM(2f)CreatingDesignMatricesByHand.html`_
#     to convert your design.mat design.con and design.fts files into plain text.
#
#     Examples
#     --------
#     >>> from nipype.interfaces.fsl import Vest2Text
#     >>> v2t = Vest2Text()
#     >>> v2t.inputs.in_file = "design.mat"
#     >>> v2t.cmdline
#     'Vest2Text design.mat design.txt'
#     >>> res = v2t.run() # doctest: +SKIP
